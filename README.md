# pyGL

### A really simple game made in OpenGL using Python.

#### For some reason it doesn't work on any PC, but mine and I couldn't figure out the problem so I switched to C++ where everyhting worked perfectly fine. Even if someone got this to work, the FPS would be really low, around 5-15FPS, because of a memory leak I believe.
#### OpenGL project: https://github.com/Tymec/OpenGL-Game
